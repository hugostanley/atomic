# Atomic - [Live Demo](https://atomic-v2pj.onrender.com/)

*NOTE: This is best accessed through your mobile phone. If the load up is taking forever, that is because I am using the free tier of Render (hosting) and Render spins down apps with inactivity.*

Atomic is a habit tracker inspired by the book Atomic habits. Tracking habits should be the easiest task to do, 
it should not even feel like a task.

This app's main purpose is ease of use.
